# Speech Recognition and Text Generation with OpenAI's GPT-3

This project is a Python-based application that uses speech recognition to convert spoken language into text, processes the text with OpenAI's GPT-3 model, and provides a spoken response. It's a simple chatbot that can respond to user's spoken queries.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- openai
- speech_recognition
- gtts
- os

## How it works

- `speak(text)`: This function converts the provided text to speech and plays the generated audio file.
- `listen()`: This function captures audio from the user's microphone, converts the speech to text, and returns the transcribed text.
- `answer(query)`: This function sends the user's query to the OpenAI GPT-3 model and prints the model's response.

## How to run

1. Install the necessary Python packages with pip:

```bash
pip install openai speechrecognition gTTS
```

2. Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the `answer(query)` function with your actual OpenAI API key.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python <script_name.py>
```

## Notes

This script is an example and may not be perfect. Make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases in production-level code. Additionally, do not expose your OpenAI API key in your scripts or code repositories.

Remember to replace `<script_name.py>` with the actual name of your Python script. And please check the pip command for installing packages. It might vary depending on your Python environment (you might need to use `pip3` or `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip`, for instance).
